# password-generator-refactor

I refactor the provided starter code for a password generator, so the password generator can dynamically generate a random password that matches all the criteria the user specifies. 

The user first clicks on the Generate Password Button to start the process of specifying what criterias the user wants their password to fulfill. After answering the prompts, this password generator displays the newly generated password inside the dashed-line box.
